#Breast-Cancer-Classification
Developed a Breast Cancer Classification model using Logistic Regression for early detection and diagnosis.
Utilized the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Conducted data preprocessing, including loading, exploring, and visualizing the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
Engineered features and created a data frame with 569 instances and 30 predictive attributes.
Achieved a comprehensive understanding of the dataset through statistical analysis and summary statistics.
Ensured data quality by checking for missing values, and confirmed a clean dataset with no null values.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-Learn.
Implemented Logistic Regression from Scikit-Learn for binary classification (malignant or benign).
Trained the model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set.
Measured model accuracy using the accuracy_score metric, achieving a high accuracy rate.
Incorporated the 'target' column into the data frame to facilitate model training.
Enhanced the interpretability of the model by adding the 'label' column with binary values (0 for malignant, 1 for benign).
Demonstrated strong analytical and programming skills in Python, including proficiency in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
Showcased data exploration and visualization skills through the use of descriptive statistics and data frame operations.
Emphasized the importance of early detection in breast cancer diagnosis, contributing to healthcare and medical research.
